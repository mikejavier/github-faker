This application was initially made to help a friend with the test of a technology company, but it ended up helping me to solidify knowledge about the Github API.

The [backend api](./api) uses an express nodejs server.

The [frontend app](./app) is using Vue. It features:

- Routing with vue-router
- State management with vuex
- Github Signin (OAuth)

hosted by [now](logingh.now.sh ) and [netfily](https://github-faker.netlify.com/)
